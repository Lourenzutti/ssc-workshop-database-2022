    "Similar to most other DBMSs, Postgres works based on a **client-sever** model. In this model\n",
    "\n",
    "- The DBMS along with its databases and data are all stored on a host computer where the database server resides. This is typically a powerful machine with high processing power and large storage\n",
    "- Client hosts are usually personal computers with GUIs that can connect to a database server to access the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, the clients and the server are connected over a network. The heavy-lifting of processing, managing and storing large amounts of data is done by the server host, and clients only retrieve the data that they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lecture1/client-server.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although sometimes used interchangeably, there is a difference between a **client/server** and a **client/server host**. A host is a device, whereas a client/server is a piece of software. For example, you can simultaneously have multiple client programs connected to a remote database. Similarly, a remote host is a device (i.e. a computer) that might have several server programs running concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of client-server models for databases has become the standard of computation and storage today, known as **cloud computing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Today we rarely store movie or music files on our computers. This is why most of us have laptops with only 256/512 GB of space, because most of that takes up space is already provided as a cloud service (e.g. Netflix, Spotify, Youtube), or is stored on cloud storage spaces (e.g. One Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive).\n",
    "- We rarely run production-stage computation-intensive jobs on our own computers. All such computations are done on cloud-computing services (e.g. Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure). I personally haven't run a single simulation code on my own computer, neither ever stored any raw data locally. I use my computer mainly as an interface to access the services that I want.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that there are certain situations where one might want to **locally** benefit from the advantages of storing data in a database. A relational database engine that works only with local databases is SQLite. If you're curious to find out the use cases for **SQLite**, take a look [here](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we use Postgres (or any other client-server DBMS), the first step before anything else is to **connect** to the database server. This is why we will talk about _host address_, _port_, _username_, and _password_ when we try to use a database."
